                General Warranty Terms <br>
                North Kiteboarding's General Warranty is subject to the following limitations: <br>
                
                North Kiteboarding warranties our products to be free from major defects in material or workmanship to the original purchaser, for a period of 365 days* from the date of purchase. *Legal warranty period may vary by country of purchase. <br>
                This Warranty covers new products purchased ONLY from an authorized North Kiteboarding centre, retailer, distributor or our North Kiteboarding online store. <br>
                All Warranty claims must be accompanied by a copy of the original purchase receipt in which the name of retailer and date of purchase must be clear and legible. <br>
                Warranty is only valid when the product is used for its normal intended recreational use and will not cover products used in teaching or rental operations unless this is an official North qualified & affiliated school. <br>
                North Kiteboarding will make the final warranty determination, which may require inspection and/or photos of the equipment which clearly show defects. If necessary, this information must be sent to your point of purchase, or your countryâ€™s North Kiteboarding distributor, postage prepaid. <br>
                If North Kiteboarding deems the product defective, the warranty only covers the repair or replacement of the defective product. North Kiteboarding will not be responsible for any costs, losses or damages incurred as a result of the loss of use of this product. <br>
                The Warranty does not cover damage caused by misuse, abuse, neglect or normal wear or tear including, but not limited to: punctures, rigging with other than North Kiteboarding components, damage due to excessive sun exposure or hot temperatures such as inside an unventilated car, damage due to the product being stored in temperatures exceeding 45 degrees Celsius, damage caused by improper handling and storage, damage caused by use in waves or shore breaks, damage caused by self-launching or self landing, damage caused by crashing the kite at high speed, damage caused by the use of kickers, sliders or other such equipment or riding on anything other than water, damage caused by using any inappropriate tools or any tool other than those specified within the installation guides and user manuals, damage caused by neglect of the care and maintenance instructions provided within the Installation Guides and User Manuals. <br>
                The Warranty does not cover board damage or breakage of any kind that is not caused by a manufacturing or materials defect. <br>
                This Warranty is void if any repair, change or modification has been made without authorization to any part of the equipment. Install only genuine North Kiteboarding spare parts, in accordance with instructions or by an Authorised Service Centre. Incorrect installation and/or use of non-genuine parts will void this warranty. <br>
                The Warranty for any repaired or replaced equipment is good from the date of the original purchase only. <br>
                There are no warranties that extend beyond the warranties specified herein. <br>
